PreToolUse hook - the guard.

Fires BEFORE every matched tool call. It inspects what the agent is about to do
and, if the call crosses a line you never want crossed, blocks it: print the
reason to stderr and exit(2). Claude Code stops the tool and hands the reason
back to the agent, so it adapts instead of doing the thing.

Two guarantees ship here:
  1. The agent can never reach your secrets - not the env file, not the other
     credential files (ssh keys, .pem, .aws, .netrc, credentials.json), and not
     by dumping the process environment. A committed `.env.example` is allowed.
  2. The agent can never run a destructive `rm -rf`.

Everything else is allowed (exit 0). The hook FAILS OPEN: any unexpected error
exits 0, so a bug in this script can never brick your session.

MAKE IT YOURS: the two `is_*` functions below are the entire policy. Add your own
(protected paths, prod config, lockfiles, migrations), or run the `hooks-create`
skill and describe the guarantee you want in plain English.

COVERAGE, HONESTLY: the hook is GUARANTEED to run. What it CATCHES is only as
good as the checks below. Three known gaps, all documented in hooks/README.md:
  - `@file` mentions in your prompt are attached without a tool call, so no
    PreToolUse hook fires for them at all.
  - The two-step route: nothing stops the agent WRITING a script that reads the
    environment and then running it. Closing that means inspecting the content
    of Write/Edit calls, not just the path.
  - A determined agent can find an encoding this regex does not match.
The hook is the enforcement point, not omniscience.

    Stripping quote characters and collapsing whitespace folds them back

    Measured: without this, the split-quote spelling walked straight through
    this guard, while an unrelated guard on the same machine caught it. Cheap
    to close, and that spelling has no innocent explanation.

    Not a general defence. A command that BUILDS the path at runtime out of
