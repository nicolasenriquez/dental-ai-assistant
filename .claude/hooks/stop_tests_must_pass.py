Stop hook - the feedback loop you cannot forget to run.

Fires when the agent tries to finish its turn. It runs your test command. If the
tests fail, it BLOCKS the stop and hands the failure output back to the agent,
which goes straight back to work. The agent literally cannot say "done" on red.

This is the single highest-value hook most projects can add. A rule that says
"always run the tests before you finish" is guidance, and the agent skips it the
moment the context gets long. This is the same instruction as a guarantee.

    exit 0 -> let it finish     exit 2 -> block the stop, stderr goes to the agent

Fails OPEN on anything unexpected, so a broken hook never traps you in a loop.

    THIS IS THE PART EVERYONE GETS WRONG, and it fails in a way that looks like

    That interpreter is NOT your project's interpreter and has none of your
    project's dependencies.

    Two things have to happen, and most write-ups only mention the first:

      1. Drop uv's throwaway venv. If you rebuild the command with
         sys.executable, or leave uv's venv first on PATH, `python -m pytest`
         runs in an environment with no pytest at all.

      2. Put the project's OWN venv first. Removing uv's venv does not activate
         yours - a hook is not your shell, so `.venv` was never on PATH. Without
         this step `python` falls through to whatever global interpreter the
         machine has, which is a different, usually broken, set of packages.

    Skip step 2 and the hook exits 2 on a perfectly green suite, with an error
    about some unrelated module. Verified: that is exactly what happens.
